# Play Chess

## Play Like a Grandmaster

âœ¨ The [players.json](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-server/blob/main/data/players.json) file in the [Chess Server](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-server) contains thousands of games by titled FIDE players. This file can be generated with the command line tools available in the [Chess Data](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-data) repo.

[Chess\Computer\GrandmasterMove](https://github.com/chesslablab/php-chess/blob/main/src/Computer/GrandmasterMove.php) figures out the next move to be made based on the players.json file that is passed to its constructor.

```php
use Chess\Computer\GrandmasterMove;
use Chess\Variant\Classical\Board;

$board = new Board();
$board->play('w', 'e4');

$gmMove = (new GrandmasterMove(__DIR__.'/../data/players.json'))->move($board);

print_r($gmMove);
```

ðŸŽ‰ Let's now put our knowledge of chess openings to the test.

## Play Computer

âœ¨ The Universal Chess Interface (UCI) is an open communication protocol that enables chess engines to communicate with user interfaces.

PHP Chess provides the [Chess\UciEngine\UciEngine](https://github.com/chesslablab/php-chess/blob/main/tests/unit/UciEngine/UciEngineTest.php) class representing an UCI engine. To follow this tutorial make sure to install Stockfish if you haven't already.

```text
sudo apt-get install stockfish
```

Then, you're set up to play chess against the computer as described in the following example.

```php
use Chess\UciEngine\UciEngine;
use Chess\UciEngine\Details\Limit;
use Chess\Variant\Classical\Board;

$board = new Board();
$board->play('w', 'e4');

$limit = (new Limit())->setDepth(3);
$stockfish = (new UciEngine('/usr/games/stockfish'))->setOption('Skill Level', 9);
$analysis = $stockfish->analysis($board, $limit);

$board->playLan('b', $analysis['bestmove']);

echo $board->getMovetext();
```

```text
1.e4 Nf6
```

You may want to play against Stockfish starting from a particular FEN with the help of [Chess\FenToBoardFactory](https://github.com/chesslablab/php-chess/blob/main/tests/unit/FenToBoardFactoryTest.php).

```php
use Chess\FenToBoardFactory;
use Chess\UciEngine\UciEngine;
use Chess\UciEngine\Details\Limit;

$board = FenToBoardFactory::create('4k2r/pp1b1pp1/8/3pPp1p/P2P1P2/1P3N2/1qr3PP/R3QR1K w k -');

$limit = (new Limit())->setDepth(12);
$stockfish = (new UciEngine('/usr/games/stockfish'))->setOption('Skill Level', 20);
$analysis = $stockfish->analysis($board, $limit);

$board->playLan('w', $analysis['bestmove']);

echo $board->getMovetext();
```

```text
1.Rb1
```

The FEN is converted to a chess board object as described in the [Data Conversion](https://php-chess.docs.chesslablab.org/data-conversion/#fen-to-board) section. Then Stockfish's depth limit is set to `12` and the skill level to `20`.

The same thing goes to starting a game from a particular SAN movetext. As you can see in the example below, [Chess\Play\SanPlay](https://github.com/chesslablab/php-chess/blob/main/tests/unit/Play/SanPlayTest.php) is used for this purpose.

```php
use Chess\Play\SanPlay;
use Chess\UciEngine\UciEngine;
use Chess\UciEngine\Details\Limit;

$movetext = '1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.e4 g6 7.Nf3 Bg7';

$board = (new SanPlay($movetext))
    ->validate()
    ->getBoard();

$limit = (new Limit())->setDepth(12);
$stockfish = (new UciEngine('/usr/games/stockfish'))->setOption('Skill Level', 20);
$analysis = $stockfish->analysis($board, $limit);

$board->playLan('w', $analysis['bestmove']);

echo $board->getMovetext();
```

```text
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.e4 g6 7.Nf3 Bg7 8.h3
```

ðŸŽ‰ Can you beat the computer? Keep it up!
