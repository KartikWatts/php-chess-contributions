# Play Chess

## Play Like a Pro

âœ¨ The [players.json](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-server/blob/main/data/players.json) file in the [Chess Server](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-server) contains thousands of games by titled FIDE players. This file can be generated and customized with the command line tools available in the [Chess Data](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-data) repo.

[Chess\Grandmaster](https://github.com/chesslablab/php-chess/blob/main/tests/unit/GrandmasterTest.php) figures out the next move to be made based on the JSON file that is passed to its constructor. Please make sure to first create one for it or feel free to use the players.json linked above.

```php
use Chess\Grandmaster;
use Chess\Variant\Classical\Board;

$board = new Board();
$board->play('w', 'e4');

$move = (new Grandmaster(__DIR__.'/../data/players.json'))->move($board);

print_r($move);
```

)
```

1.e4 e5 is the move that a grandmaster would play. As you can see in this example, Chess\Grandmaster could find a response to 1.e4 returning the corresponding game's metadata.

ðŸŽ‰ Let's now put our knowledge of chess openings to the test.

## Play Computer

âœ¨ UCI engines not only allow to play chess with the computer but are also a helpful tool when analyzing chess games.

[Chess\UciEngine\UciEngine](https://github.com/chesslablab/php-chess/blob/main/tests/unit/UciEngine/UciEngineTest.php) allows to play chess against the Stockfish chess engine using PHP, but first things first, make sure to install Stockfish on your computer.

```text
sudo apt-get install stockfish
```

Then, you're set up to play chess against Stockfish as described in the following example.

```php
use Chess\UciEngine\UciEngine;
use Chess\UciEngine\Details\Limit;
use Chess\Variant\Classical\Board;

$board = new Board();
$board->play('w', 'e4');

$limit = (new Limit())->setDepth(3);
$stockfish = (new UciEngine('/usr/games/stockfish'))->setOption('Skill Level', 9);
$analysis = $stockfish->analysis($board, $limit);

$board->playLan('b', $analysis['bestmove']);

echo $board->getMovetext();
```

```text
1.e4 Nf6
```

PHP Chess classes can be combined to do different things. For example, you may want to play against Stockfish from this FEN position published in your favorite online publication.

```php
use Chess\FenToBoardFactory;
use Chess\UciEngine\UciEngine;
use Chess\UciEngine\Details\Limit;

$board = FenToBoardFactory::create('4k2r/pp1b1pp1/8/3pPp1p/P2P1P2/1P3N2/1qr3PP/R3QR1K w k -');

$limit = (new Limit())->setDepth(12);
$stockfish = (new UciEngine('/usr/games/stockfish'))->setOption('Skill Level', 20);
$analysis = $stockfish->analysis($board, $limit);

$board->playLan('w', $analysis['bestmove']);

echo $board->getMovetext();
```

```text
1.Rb1
```

The FEN is converted to a chessboard object as described in [Convert FEN to Board](https://php-chess.docs.chesslablab.org/convert-fen-to-board/). The `Skill Level` is set to `20` and the depth is set to `12` in order to get a more accurate response from Stockfish.

The same thing goes for PGN annotated games. This is how to play against Stockfish after loading a SAN movetext into a chess board object.

```php
use Chess\Play\SanPlay;
use Chess\UciEngine\UciEngine;
use Chess\UciEngine\Details\Limit;

$movetext = '1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.e4 g6 7.Nf3 Bg7';

$board = (new SanPlay($movetext))
    ->validate()
    ->getBoard();

$limit = (new Limit())->setDepth(12);
$stockfish = (new UciEngine('/usr/games/stockfish'))->setOption('Skill Level', 20);
$analysis = $stockfish->analysis($board, $limit);

$board->playLan('w', $analysis['bestmove']);

echo $board->getMovetext();
```

```text
1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.e4 g6 7.Nf3 Bg7 8.h3
```

As you can see, Stockfish responds with 8.h3.

ðŸŽ‰ Can you beat the computer? Keep it up!
