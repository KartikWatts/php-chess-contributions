# Explain FEN

âœ¨ Beginners often approach chess by trying to deliver checkmate quickly. However, there are so many different things to look at in order to understand a chess position.

[Chess\Tutor\FenParagraph](https://github.com/chesslablab/php-chess/blob/master/tests/unit/Tutor/FenParagraphTest.php) helps you improve your chess thinking process by explaining a chess position like a chess tutor would do.

```php
use Chess\Tutor\FenParagraph;

$fen = '8/5k2/4n3/8/8/1BK5/1B6/8 w - - 0 1';

$paragraph = (new FenParagraph($fen))->getParagraph();

$text = implode(' ', $paragraph);

echo $text;
```

```text
White has a significant material advantage. White has a significant control of the center. The white pieces are somewhat better connected. The white player is pressuring a little bit more squares than its opponent. The knight on e6 is pinned so it can't be moved because the king would be put in check. White has the bishop pair.
```

ðŸŽ‰ The resulting text may sound a little robotic but it can be easily rephrased by an AI to make it sound more human-like.
